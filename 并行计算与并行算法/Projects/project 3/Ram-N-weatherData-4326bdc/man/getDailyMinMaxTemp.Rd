\title{Get the daily minimum (maximum) temperatures for a given weather stations}
\usage{
getDailyMinMaxTemp(station_id, start_date, end_date = NULL,
  daily_min = TRUE, daily_max = TRUE, station_type = "airportCode",
  opt_write_to_file = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_id}{is a valid 3- or 4-letter Airport code or a valid Weather Station ID
(example: "BUF", "ORD", "VABB" for Mumbai).
Valid Weather Station "id" values: "KFLMIAMI75" or "IMOSCOWO2" You can look these up
 at wunderground.com}

\item{start_date}{is a valid string representing a date in the past (YYYY-MM-DD, all numeric)}

\item{end_date}{(optional) If an interval is to be specified, end_date 
is a a valid string representing a date in the past (YYYY-MM-DD, all numeric) 
and greater than start_date}

\item{daily_min}{A boolean indicating if the Minimum Temperatures are desired}

\item{daily_max}{A boolean indicating if the Maximum Temperatures are desired
Both \code{daily_min} and \code{daily_max} can be TRUE, but at least one of 
them should be TRUE.}

\item{station_type}{= "airportCode" or "ID" (Wx call Sign)}

\item{opt_write_to_file}{If TRUE, the resulting dataframe will be stored in a CSV file. 
Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A data frame with each row containing: \itemize{
\item Date and Time stamp (for when that day's minimum temperature was recorded)
\item Minimum Temperature for the station in Farenheit (or Celcius)
\item Date and Time stamp (for when that day's maximum temperature was recorded)
\item Maximum Temperature for the station in Farenheit (or Celcius)
}
}
\description{
Given a StationID and a set of dates, this function returns the 
Daily Minimum and/or Maximum temperatures recorded, along with timestamps
}
\details{
This functions fetches all the records for 
each date specified, but it only retaints the min and/or max record, along 
 with the timestamp.
}
