Marat is heavily inspired by [L'Ami du peuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ami_du_peuple), a newspaper written by [Jean-Paul Marat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat) during the French Revolution, and thus may not be used to promote any form of totalitarianism and should rather be used to advance democracy and revive the Age of Reason.

Marat is fully responsive, light and fast.
